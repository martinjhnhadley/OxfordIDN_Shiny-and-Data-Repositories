## Dropbox Overview

[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) is a tremendously popular and powerful file sharing platform, it is *not* a fully-fledged data repository service and should not be used as if it were - it does not provide DOI and rate limits public access to files. However, there are many cases where it is useful to host data files on Dropbox during a project particularly where collaborations with other users are important. Publicly shared files can be accessed via a link, for instance: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yht5dt4o3ec7rof/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/yht5dt4o3ec7rof/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv?dl=0</a>

The service provides a free tier that suits most of its users, and what this guide considers. There are some important considerations to take into account when deciding to use a free file sharing platform:

- Bandwidth Limiting
- Changes to service

Publicly shared files in a free Dropbox account cannot be accessed without limit, the limits imposed are explained in detail <a href=https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/4204>here</a>. At the time of writing, 20th July 2016, the limits can be summarised as follows:

- The total amount of traffic that all of your links and file requests together can generate without getting banned is 20 GB per day.
- The total number of downloads that all of your links together can generate is 100,000 downloads per day.
- For paid accounts (Â£79/year) the download limit is removed and the bandwidth limit is increased to 200 GB.

These limits are fairly standard for the industry and are generous, it is unlikely that the files you may wish to share via Dropbox and include within Shiny apps.

It is important to note that free accounts are subject to change without notice (to the extent detailed within Dropbox's [Terms of Service](https://www.dropbox.com/en_GB/privacy#terms)). There is historical precedence for Dropbox changing its service in a manner that might negatively affect a shiny app dependent on the platform, see details about the [new sharing model of 2012](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2012/06/new-sharing-model-will-replace-public-folder/). 

In general, Dropbox is widely recognised as being an integral component of many other services and therefore cannot radically change or revoke it's service without significant fallout but it is important that you do not build a funding bid or research service that is critically dependent on a free service like Dropbox. This is one of the reasons why caching files within shiny app directories is important, though.

### Dropbox API Access with rdrop2

The <a href=https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2>rdrop2</a> library provides a very useful wrapper for the Dropbox API, that allows the following operations to be performed:

- Access account details
- Access file information
- Read files
- Write files

In order to use the library it must be loaded and authenticated against your Dropbox account - note that this will launch a browser window.

```{r}
library(rdrop2)
drop_auth()
```

For shiny apps it is necessary to locally store the authentication token returned by `drop_auth`, the simplest method to ensure this works is to use `saveRDS` and `readRDS` to save and load the R object. The `token` *must* then be provided to every `drop_*` function call in a shiny app via the named argument `dtoken`; there isn't issue in doing this within an interactive R session, as seen in this document. It is important to remember that the .RDS file contains private information that would allow others access to your Dropbox account, ensure to include this file in your `.gitignore` file if you are using git.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rdrop2)
token <- drop_auth(new_user = TRUE)
saveRDS(token, "droptoken.rds")
token <- readRDS("droptoken.rds")
## drop_acc returns user details
drop_acc(dtoken = token)
```

```{r, include=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(rdrop2)
token <- readRDS("droptoken.rds")
drop_acc(dtoken = token)
```

Note that files may be accessed directly with their public links, however Dropbox does not provide the ability to easily test whether a file exists (or their service is down) via HTTP response headers. You are therefore advised to use the API, even for publicly shared files. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
head(read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/yht5dt4o3ec7rof/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv?dl=1"))
```

### Reading Files

Files can be downloaded from Dropbox with the `drop_get` function, they're saved into the file specified to `local_file` and it is important to note by default the function will not `overwrite` files.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
drop_get('/Private_Cache-Tests/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv', local_file = "pms_data.csv", overwrite = TRUE, dtoken = token, verbose = FALSE)
head(read.csv("pms_data.csv"))
```

Note that if a file does not exist, `drop_get` will return `FALSE`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
drop_get('/Private_Cache-Tests/non-existant.csv', local_file = "pms_data.csv", dtoken = token)
```

### Local Caching of Files

In this instance, caching means keeping a local copy of a dataset that is "replaced" if the remote file is updated. This provides two advantages, if Dropbox is not available when the code is run the local copy provides a backup solution and prevents re-downloading potentially large datasets if no changes are detected. In the case of a shiny app this requires persistant data stores, there is a fairly technical description of persistant data storage in shiny apps available <a href=http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/persistent-data-storage.html>here</a> that is used as the template for the caching mechanism this tutorial describes. The procedure depends on the following paradigm:

```
"you save a new file every time there is new data"
```

The versioning of file sharing services like Dropbox is not something that we will rely on for checking whether external files have been updated as there are potential hidden states and complexities that are undocumented. Therefore the caching procedure implemented below simply checks modification date, which may well result in unnecessary downloads of the remote file.

The caching mechanism employed in this tutorial is as follows:

- Check remote file exists
- FALSE: Import local file with most recent modification date
- TRUE: Next step
- Check remote file is newer than local files
- TRUE: Download remote file to local directory and import
- FALSE: Import local file with most recent modification date

There is one exception to this procedure:

- The first time the app is launched after deployment, always grab the remote file (if possible) to account for possible file changes during deployment.

Further, this procedure does not attempt to account for deltas and simply downloads a new copy of the remote file whenever it is updated - this could result in a large number of files within the shiny app. To account for this, the following step is added to the procedure:

- If more than 5 local files exist, purge the oldest 3.

The two sections below describe a script for caching on a local machine and in a shiny app, note that the shiny app utilises functions and code from the local script.

#### Local Script

Set the `original_file_name` variable and define a function for creating unique file names based on `Sys.time` and a single random real number from `runif`. This is designed to account for multiple users of the shiny app attempting to create new files at exactly the same time, there is an extremely low probability of naming conflicts using this convention.

```{r}
original_file_name <- "pms_data.csv"
unique_name_fn <- function(){sprintf("%s_%s.csv", digest::digest(paste0(as.integer(Sys.time()),runif(1))), "user_downloaded")}
```

There are many exit points in our procedure where the filenames must be ordered according to their modification date, this is a utility function that provides the filenames in modified date order:

```{r}
sort_locals_by_date <- function() {
  all_local_files <-
    c(original_file_name, list.files()[grepl(pattern = "user[_]downloaded", list.files())])
  all_local_files_mtime <-
    unlist(lapply(all_local_files, function(x)
      file.mtime(x)))
  sort_locals_by_date <-
    all_local_files[order(all_local_files_mtime)]
  sort_locals_by_date
}
```

The condition that no more than 5 updates files are stored in the directory is assured via the following utility function:

```{r}
clear_downloaded_files <- function() {
  if (sum(grepl(pattern = "user[_]downloaded", list.files())) > 5) {
    sorted_files <- sort_locals_by_date()
    sorted_files <-
      sorted_files[grepl(pattern = "user[_]downloaded", sorted_files)]
    lapply(sorted_files[1:3], function(x)
      file.remove(x))
  }
}
```

The procedure is now converted into a nested if test utilising the utility functions above:

```{r}
## Check file exists
if (drop_exists('/Private_Cache-Tests/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv', dtoken = token)) {
  if (any(grepl(pattern = "user[_]downloaded", list.files()))) {
    ## there are updated files
    ## Get modification times for local and external file
    all_local_files <-
      c(original_file_name, list.files()[grepl(pattern = "user[_]downloaded", list.files())])
    all_local_files_mtime <-
      unlist(lapply(all_local_files, function(x)
        file.mtime(x)))
    remote_file_mtime <-
      dmy_hms(drop_history('/Private_Cache-Tests/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv', dtoken = token)[1, modified])
    
    if (!any(all_local_files_mtime > as.integer(remote_file_mtime))) {
      drop_get(
        '/Private_Cache-Tests/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv',
        local_file = unique_name_fn(),
        overwrite = T,
        dtoken = token
      )
      sorted_files <- sort_locals_by_date()
      ## Import most recently updated file
      data_to_use <-
        read.csv(sorted_files[length(sorted_files)])
      clear_downloaded_files()
    } else {
      sorted_files <- sort_locals_by_date()
      ## Import most recently updated file
      data_to_use <-
        read.csv(sorted_files[length(sorted_files)])
      clear_downloaded_files()
    }
  } else {
    ## first deploy, get file and import
    drop_get(
      '/Private_Cache-Tests/UK_Prime_Ministers.csv',
      local_file = unique_name_fn(),
      overwrite = T,
      dtoken = token
    )
    sorted_files <- sort_locals_by_date()
    ## Import most recently updated file
    data_to_use <-
      read.csv(sorted_files[length(sorted_files)])
    clear_downloaded_files()
  }
} else {
  ## if external file does not exist
  sorted_files <- sort_locals_by_date()
  ## Import most recently updated file
  data_to_use <- read.csv(sorted_files[length(sorted_files)])
  clear_downloaded_files()
}
```


#### Shiny Script

The directory "Dropbox_Cache_Example" contains a shiny app that pulls from the same Dropbox file as above using the same caching methodology, the application's workhorse is an `eventReactive` call. When the "submit" button is clicked in the app the procedure described above is initiated and the result is supplied to the reactive variable `uk_prime_ministers` which is then called within `renderDataTable`. Note that to ensure that new files are checked for when the app is first loaded, the argument `ignoreNULL = FALSE` has been provied to `eventReactive`.

```{r, eval=F}
## Shiny Server File

## Load token
token <- readRDS("droptoken.rds")

original_file_name <- "pms_data.csv"
unique_name_fn <- function() {
} ## See above

sort_locals_by_date <- function() {
} ## See above

clear_downloaded_files <- function(){
} ## See above

shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  uk_prime_ministers <- eventReactive(input$actionButtonID,
                                      {
                                        # Nested if from above
                                      },
                                      ignoreNULL = FALSE # Forces evaluation when app first loaded )
}

output$summary <- renderDataTable({
  uk_prime_ministers()
}))
```

The shiny app can then be deployed as follows:

```{r, eval=F}
library(shiny)
library(rsconnect)
deployApp(appDir = "unique-filename-shiny/", appName = "Dropbox_Cache_Example")
```

Below is an embedded copy of this application, the code for which is available [here](https://github.com/martinjhnhadley/Live-Data_Scripts-and-Templates/tree/gh-pages/Repositories/Dropbox/Dropbox_Cache_Example).
