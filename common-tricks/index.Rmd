Many of the libraries and techniques discussed within this tutorial rely on a few "standard tricks" or rather, knowledge of specific programming patterns.

# Non-Interactive Web Sessions

The reason these tricks are required is because you are not in an interactive session.

# .httr-oauth

Require a local file

## Publishing to Shiny Apps

Shiny apps depend on a local copy of the `.httr-oath` file for authentification without an interactive environment, unfortunately the "publish" command in RStudio is poorly behaved - it will not upload the "hidden" `.httr-oath` file and your uploaded app will therefore not work!

A good reference for this is hard to come by, but second-hand confirmation from RStudio themselves is available here: https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets/issues/235#issuecomment-207507363.

It is very easy to overcome this issue, simply deploy the app programmatically with these steps:

1. Create a file called deployApp.R in the same directory as the Shiny app
1. Add the following code:

```{r, eval=F}
library(shiny)
library(rsconnect)
deployApp()
```
